# Latching Power Circuit: Extreme Power Saving (0ÂµA) with Any Microcontroller

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to build an Auto Power Off circuit (Latching Power Circuit) on a custom PCB, which is extremely useful to save power in your electronics projects.

An Auto Power Off Circuit or also called Latching Power Circuit allows you to cut off power completely when a microcontroller is not executing any task, which is great to make batteries last longer in your electronics projects.
